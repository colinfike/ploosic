Ploosic is an app that allows a user to play music from youtube, soundcloud, bandcamp(SOON), etc in a single app/playlist without having to swap between the services or download the files to your machine.

Currently in a V1.0 state where a user can access a personal playlist that they can add songs via url from YouTube/SoundCloud and play those songs with your standard play/pause/previous/next functionality. 

[Demo Here (SOON)](https://ploosic.com)
