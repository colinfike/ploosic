# ploosic ![Ploosic Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/colinfike/ploosic.svg?branch=master)

Ploosic is an app that allows a user to play music from youtube, soundcloud, bandcamp(SOON), etc in a single app/playlist without having to swap between the services or download the files to your machine. The site is responsive but currently the widgets don't function as I'd like on mobile so for now mobile will not work.

Currently in a V1.0 state where a user can access a personal playlist that they can add songs via url from YouTube/SoundCloud and play those songs with your standard play/pause/previous/next functionality.

[Demo Here (SOON)](https://ploosic.com)

# ToDo

1. Add BandCamp
2. Add Private Playlists
3. Add seeking/scrubbing through a song
4. ~~Add Shuffle~~
5. Add Repeat
6. Make the UI a little more robust as the functionality comes along
7. Add stat tracking (models in place but no functionality yet)
8. Update tests and increase teste coverage, currently a pretty comprehensive test suite but does not currently test the javascript for the players.
9. Modify/delete tracks
10. Pick start/end times for tracks
11. Clean invalid links such as youtube links with playlists information in them
12. Get the widget functionality working properly on mobile
