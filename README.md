## NO LONGER IN DEVELOPMENT ##
Taking a little break from this to work on other things. The site is also no longer hosted unfortunately.

Ploosic is an app that allows a user to play music from youtube, soundcloud, bandcamp(SOON), etc in a single app/playlist without having to swap between the services or download the files to your machine. The site is responsive but currently the widgets don't function as I'd like on mobile so for now mobile will not work.

Currently in a V1.0 state where a user can access a personal playlist that they can add songs via url from YouTube/SoundCloud and play those songs with your standard play/pause/previous/next functionality.
